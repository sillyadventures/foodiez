// what is this file for? I'll explain on thursday
// for the curious read here https://jeremiahalex.gitbooks.io/wdi-sg/content/05-express/express-mongoose/readme.html

// we don't run our node here, we run our node in index.js

// remember your ERD, this is where the diagram is your help to write the code
const restaurantSchema = new Schema({
  // <fields name>: <type> OR

  // <fields name>: {
  //   type: <type>,
  //   other stuff I'll explain
  // }

  // compare the structure here with your restaurants data
